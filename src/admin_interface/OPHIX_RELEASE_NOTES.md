# Ophix Admin Interface Release Notes

## Unreleased

- Bundled "Ophix" default theme with Ophix Project branding; installed automatically
  on `migrate` — active by default on fresh installs, inactive alongside existing themes.
- Added `logo_dark` field to `Theme` model — optional logo shown when the OS/browser
  is in dark mode. When set, the header logo switches automatically via `<picture>` +
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Leave blank to use the standard logo in all modes.
  Theme authors: store the dark variant in `media/admin-interface/themes/<Name>/logo_dark/`.

## 2026.05.19.01

- Added `OPHIX_RELEASE_NOTES.md` for release notes delivery.
