# Ophix Admin Interface Release Notes

## 2026.05.22.01

- Theme deletion now removes the namespaced media directory (`MEDIA_ROOT/admin-interface/themes/<name>/`)
  via `post_delete` signal, covering both UI deletion and the `delete_theme` management command.
  Previously, UI-initiated deletions left media files on disk. `delete_theme --preserve-media` still
  suppresses cleanup when needed.

## 2026.05.21.01

- Fixed migration 0035: `logo_dark` `upload_to` was stored as a static string
  instead of the callable, causing Django to report pending model changes after
  the migration had already been applied.

## 2026.05.20.02

- Fixed bundled Ophix theme media path: logo file was copied to the wrong
  destination under `MEDIA_ROOT`. Restructured bundled `media/` directory to
  use the flat `media/<field>/` layout that `install_bundled_theme` expects.
- `install_bundled_theme` now always copies media files on every migrate run,
  not only when the theme is first installed. Fixes missing assets on existing
  installs after an upgrade.
- Bundled Ophix theme title is now populated from `SERVER_NAME` on first
  install (e.g. "Ophix credserver"). Only fills a blank title — never
  overwrites a value the operator has already set.

## 2026.05.20.01

- Bundled "Ophix" default theme with Ophix Project branding; installed automatically
  on `migrate` — active by default on fresh installs, inactive alongside existing themes.
- Added `logo_dark` field to `Theme` model — optional logo shown when the OS/browser
  is in dark mode. When set, the header logo switches automatically via `<picture>` +
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Leave blank to use the standard logo in all modes.
  Theme authors: store the dark variant in `media/admin-interface/themes/<Name>/logo_dark/`.

## 2026.05.19.01

- Added `OPHIX_RELEASE_NOTES.md` for release notes delivery.
